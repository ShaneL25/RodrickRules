    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      *Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules* is the second book in the Wimpy Kid series. The story is told from first person by Greg Heffley, who is in middle school and lives with his mom, dad, older brother Rodrick, and younger brother manny. He also has his best friend rowley jefferson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the summer, Greg dealt with embarrassment and family tension. As the school year starts, Greg tries to avoid trouble but often gets dragged in by Rodrick. Their mom begins a “Mom Bucks” program to encourage them to behave and get along. Rodrick has a science project due, but he doesn’t want to do it himself and tries to get Greg and others to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Rodrick fakes being sick and their parents leave town, he throws a wild party at home and locks Greg in the basement to keep him from telling. Greg sneaks photos of the party as leverage. Their mother later discovers evidence of what happened, and both brothers face punishments. The book ends with Greg deciding to help Rodrick with his science project so Rodrick won’t fail and Greg won't be disgraced by the party scandal.
